Passing Network Analysis of the 2015 Barca and 2011 Barca Teams

As a Barca fan myself, I've often viewed the 2011 and 2015 UCL winning Barcelona teams as drastically different. Though only 4 years apart, and with much of the team similar, the sides differed in their buildup patterns and offensive philosophies. 

Through this project, I explore the patterns and differences in passing between the two sides through studying their passing netorks.
